            <h2>Jordan Graham</h2>
            <p2>Good Day, my name is Jordan Graham and I am a year 2 student attending The University of the West Indies PErsuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I knew this is what I wanted to do as I had keen interest in the software side of technology since the age of 14 years old. AS I grew older, I learnt about how much Web Development and generally softwares have inpacted our everyday life and chose that if I could make someones life better using software then I would do it. </p2>
